## What is BetterGPT?
ChatGPT and similar platforms often restrict free users with limitations and charge high prices for premium features.

BetterGPT is built on the belief that everyone should have access to the full potential of AI chatbots. We offer a feature-rich platform with [(almost) no restrictions](/what/limitations/), allowing you to explore effective learning, creative writing, and more without limitations.

## How does it work?
BetterGPT essentially consists of three different components to provide you with a seamless experience.
1. The Google Gemini API: One of the most advanced AI model families, giving you access to cutting-edge LLM capabilities.
2. Web API: Unlimited access to text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities, allowing you to hear your chatbot's responses in a natural-sounding voice.
3. Open WebUI: An easy-to-use, open source front-end for a smooth and intuitive workflow that is updated regularly.
